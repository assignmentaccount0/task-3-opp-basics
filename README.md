### Description

**Rectangle** class and inherited child **Parallelepipede** class 

* Write a **Rectangle** class in Python language, allowing you to build a rectangle with length and width attributes.
* Create a **Perimeter()** method to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle and a **Area()** method to calculate the area of ​​the rectangle.
* Create a method **display()** that display the length, width, perimeter and area of an object created using an instantiation on rectangle class.
* Create a **Parallelepipede** child class inheriting from the **Rectangle** class and with a height attribute and another **Volume()** method to calculate the volume of the **Parallelepiped**.

### Description

**Bank Account** class:

* Create a Python class called **BankAccount** which represents a bank account, having as attributes: **accountNumber** (numeric type), **name** (name of the account owner as string type), **balance**.
* Create a constructor with parameters: **accountNumber**, **name**, **balance**.
* Create a **Deposit()** method which manages the deposit actions.
* Create a **Withdrawal()** method  which manages withdrawals actions.

## Assignment 3  :star:  :star:  :star:  :star:

### Description

Computation class:
1) Create a **Coputation** class with a default constructor (without parameters) allowing to perform various calculations on integers numbers.
2) Create a method called **Factorial()** which allows to calculate the factorial of an integer. Test the method by instantiating the class.
3) Create a method called **Sum()** allowing to calculate the sum of the first n integers ```1 + 2 + 3 + .. + n```. Test this method.
4) Create a method called **testPrim()** in  the **Coputation** class to test the primality of a given integer. Test this method.
5) Create  a method called **testPrims()** allowing to test if two numbers are prime between them.
6) Create a **tableMult()** method which creates and displays the multiplication table of a given integer. Then create an **allTablesMult()** method to display all the integer multiplication tables ```1, 2, 3, ..., 9```.
7) Create a static **listDiv()** method that gets all the divisors of a given integer on new list called  **Ldiv**. Create another **listDivPrim()** method that gets all the prime divisors of a given integer.
